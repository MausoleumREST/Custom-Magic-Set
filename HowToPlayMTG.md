# Summoning Sickness
302. Creatures
302.6 A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol or the untap symbol in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. A creature can’t attack unless it has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. This rule is informally called the “summoning sickness” rule.

Only Creatures are affected by summoning sickness.

# The artwork has no effect on gameplay

203. Illustration
203.1. The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no effect on gameplay. For example, a creature doesn't have the flying ability unless stated in its rules text, even if it's depicted as flying.

---

# The stack

It is a first in, last out system.

405. Stack
405.1. When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see rule 601.2a). When an ability is activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules 602.2a and 603.3).
405.2. The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object is pot on the stack, it's put on top of all objects already there.

Blossoming Calm -- top of the stack
Counterspell
Ulamog's cast ability
Ulamog, the Ceasless Hunger -- bottom of the stack

# Every nonland card is a spell!

Think of creature cards as summon creature, not just instants and sorceries:

112. Spells
112.1 A Spell is a card on the stack. As the first step of being cast, teh card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually the owner's hand.

A spell remains on the stack until it resolves, is countered, or otherwise leaves the stack.

---

# Priority

is the right to cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action. Players can't cast spells, activate abilities or take special actions at a time when they do not have priority. The player with priority may put as many spells or abilities on the stack as they wish, but before anything can resolve all players must "pass priority" without adding anything further to the stack.
Priority is passed in turn order, starting with the player whose turn is.
You can react to your own spells, but you must announce it first.

# Turn anatomy
- Untap -> You untap all permanents 
- Upkeep -> Inherently nothing happnes here, unless cards say so
- Draw -> You draw the top card from your deck
- 1st Main Phase
- Combat
- 2nd Main Phase
- End Step -> Discard cards if you are over your hand size

---

# Main Phase
The two main phases are not different.
You can play 1 land per turn, cast any number of spells and/or activate any number of abilies.

---

# Combat Phase
- Beginning of combat
- Declare attackers -> Only untapped creatures can attack, and they become tapped after being declared as attackers.
- Declare blockers -> Only untapped creatures can be assigned as blockers; an attacking creature can be blocked by multile defending creatures.
- Damage
- End of combat

The defending player assigns how blockers are declared an assigned.

---

# Combat shennanigans
- You attack a player or a planeswalker, this is not Hearthstone. : ^)
- A blocked creature remains blocked.

# The Legend rule

704.5j If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards.

---

# Can't beats can

Golden rule of Magic:

101.2. When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can't happen, the "can't" effect takes precedence.

Example: If one effect reads "You may play an additional land this turn" and another reads "You can't play lands this turn", teh effect that precludes you from playing lands wins.

# Commander's Rules

Your commander is in a special zone named the command zone, not in your hand. Whenevr your commander would be put into a zone except your hand, the battlefield or the command zone you may choose to place it in the command zone.

Queen Apinah: The last ability of Queen Apinah (long may she reign) checks to see if an opponent is the monarch as your upkeep begins. If no opponent is the monarch, Queen Apinah's (long may she reign) ability won't trigger at all.
